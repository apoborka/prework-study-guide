# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage contains study materials for the prework portion of the Ohio State Coding Bootcamp. Divided into four major categories (HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript), this page will act as a single-source for all important information that will be referenced throughout the bootcamp program and will be expanded upon as the course continues.

As learning to code is a complex and nuanced undertaking, staying well organized will be essential to success. The goal of this project is to aid in the retention of a vast quanitiy of information and to outline the standardized procedures that will be commonplace throughout the Bootcamp in order to be an effective and consistent programmer beyond the completion of the course.

During this prework project, I learned how the different languages discussed in the prework are used in conjunction in order to create a functional project (HTML acting as a framework for the information contained within an web page/application, CSS providing organization and readability of the contents, JavaScript functions allowing for interactivity, and Git functionality that allows for incremental progress and iteration). As the scope of the bootcamp expands, so too will this project and the wealth of information contained within it.

## Usage

To use the application, visit the GitHub page associated with the project to view the study guide materials. The study topics are ordered chronologically, starting with the first topic we covered, HTML, followed by CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

While on the page, open the DevTools console to view the console log output of two JavaScript functions. The first function displays all of the topics covered in the prework. The second function randomly chooses an initial study topic for the user to get started with.
